``opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``collation``: Configure textual comparisons. See :ref:`Setting Collation Order <setting_collation_order>`, and `the MongoDB Manual entry on Collation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/collation/>`_. Collation requires MongoDB 3.2 or later, otherwise an error is returned.
* ``hint``: A document or string that specifies the index to use to support the query predicate.

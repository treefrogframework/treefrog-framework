.SH TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
.sp
The following is a short list of things to check when you have a problem.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Did you call \fBmongoc_init()\fP in \fBmain()\fP? If not, you will likely see a segfault.
.IP \(bu 2
Have you leaked any clients or cursors as can be found with \fBmongoc\-stat <PID>\fP?
.IP \(bu 2
Have packets been delivered to the server? See egress bytes from \fBmongoc\-stat <PID>\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Does \fBvalgrind\fP show any leaks? Ensure you call \fBmongoc_cleanup()\fP at the end of your process to cleanup lingering allocations from the MongoDB C driver.
.IP \(bu 2
If compiling your own copy of MongoDB C Driver, consider using the cmake option \fB\-DENABLE_TRACING=ON\fP to enable function tracing and hex dumps of network packets to \fBSTDERR\fP and \fBSTDOUT\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH PERFORMANCE COUNTERS
.sp
The MongoDB C driver comes with an optional unique feature to help developers and sysadmins troubleshoot problems in production.
Performance counters are available for each process using the driver.
If available, the counters can be accessed outside of the application process via a shared memory segment.
This means that you can graph statistics about your application process easily from tools like Munin or Nagios.
Your author often uses \fBwatch \-\-interval=0.5 \-d mongoc\-stat $PID\fP to monitor an application.
.sp
Performance counters are only available on Linux platforms and macOS arm64 platforms supporting shared memory segments.
On supported platforms they are enabled by default.
Applications can be built without the counters by specifying the cmake option \fB\-DENABLE_SHM_COUNTERS=OFF\fP\&. Additionally, if
performance counters are already compiled, they can be disabled at runtime by specifying the environment variable \fBMONGOC_DISABLE_SHM\fP\&.
.sp
Performance counters keep track of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Active and Disposed Cursors
.IP \(bu 2
Active and Disposed Clients, Client Pools, and Socket Streams.
.IP \(bu 2
Number of operations sent and received, by type.
.IP \(bu 2
Bytes transferred and received.
.IP \(bu 2
Authentication successes and failures.
.IP \(bu 2
Number of wire protocol errors.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To access counters for a given process, simply provide the process id to the \fBmongoc\-stat\fP program installed with the MongoDB C Driver.

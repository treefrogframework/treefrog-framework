.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBw\fP: A positive \fBint32_t\fP or zero.
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Sets the \fBw\fP value for the write concern. See \fBmongoc_write_concern_t\fP for more information on this setting.
.sp
Unacknowledged writes are not causally consistent. If you execute a write operation with a \fBmongoc_write_concern_t\fP on which you have called \fBmongoc_write_concern_set_w\fP with a value of 0, the write does not participate in causal consistency, even when executed with a \fBmongoc_client_session_t\fP\&.
.sp
Beginning in version 1.9.0, this function can now alter the write concern after
it has been used in an operation. Previously, using the struct with an operation
would mark it as "frozen" and calling this function would log a warning instead
instead of altering the write concern.

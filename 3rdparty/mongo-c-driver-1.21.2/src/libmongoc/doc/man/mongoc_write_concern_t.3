Write Concern abstraction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmongoc_write_concern_t\fP tells the driver what level of acknowledgement to await from the server. The default, MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_DEFAULT, is right for the great majority of applications.
.sp
You can specify a write concern on connection objects, database objects, collection objects, or per\-operation. Data\-modifying operations typically use the write concern of the object they operate on, and check the server response for a write concern error or write concern timeout. For example, \fBmongoc_collection_drop_index\fP uses the collection\(aqs write concern, and a write concern error or timeout in the response is considered a failure.
.sp
Exceptions to this principle are the generic command functions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_client_command\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_client_command_simple\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_database_command\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_database_command_simple\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_collection_command\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmongoc_collection_command_simple\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
These generic command functions do not automatically apply a write concern, and they do not check the server response for a write concern error or write concern timeout.
.sp
See \fI\%Write Concern\fP on the MongoDB website for more information.
.SH WRITE CONCERN LEVELS
.sp
Set the write concern level with \fBmongoc_write_concern_set_w\fP\&.

T{
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_DEFAULT (1)
T}	T{
By default, writes block awaiting acknowledgement from MongoDB. Acknowledged write concern allows clients to catch network, duplicate key, and other errors.
T}
_
T{
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_UNACKNOWLEDGED (0)
T}	T{
With this write concern, MongoDB does not acknowledge the receipt of write operation. Unacknowledged is similar to errors ignored; however, mongoc attempts to receive and handle network errors when possible.

T{
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_MAJORITY (majority)

Block until a write has been propagated to a majority of the nodes in the replica set.

Block until a write has been propagated to at least \fBn\fP nodes in the replica set.

.SH DEPRECATIONS
.sp
The write concern \fBMONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_ERRORS_IGNORED\fP (value \-1) is a deprecated synonym for \fBMONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_UNACKNOWLEDGED\fP (value 0), and will be removed in the next major release.
.sp
\fBmongoc_write_concern_set_fsync\fP is deprecated.

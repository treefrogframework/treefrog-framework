Versioning Files
################

.. file:: VERSION_CURRENT

  This file contains the full version number of the current working copy of the
  project. During development, this should be ``x.y.z-dev``. On tagged commits,
  this will have the prerelease tag removed.

  .. note::

    Previously, this file was auto-generated by inspecting the Git history. This
    proved to be somewhat finicky and depended on the local Git history to have
    all the proper metadata in place, which wasn't always reliable.

  .. note::

    The version number ``x.y.z`` in this file is read by CMake at configure-time
    and is used as the version number for the ``project()`` call in the
    top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``


.. file:: etc/prior_version.txt

  This file, like `VERSION_CURRENT`, contains a version number string. Instead
  of referring to the current working copy version, this refers to the most
  recent stable release. This is used by various tasks to "compare" the working
  copy against the stable version. This version number should correspond to a
  published Git tag.

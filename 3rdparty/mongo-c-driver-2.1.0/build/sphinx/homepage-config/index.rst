MongoDB C Driver - API
======================

**A Cross Platform MongoDB Client Library for C**

The MongoDB C Driver, also known as "libmongoc", is a library for using MongoDB from C applications, and for writing MongoDB drivers in higher-level languages.

It depends on `libbson <libbson/current/index.html>`_ to generate and parse BSON documents, the native data format of MongoDB.

This site documents the API. For tutorials, guides, and explainers, see `MongoDB C Driver <mongodb_docs_cdriver_>`_.

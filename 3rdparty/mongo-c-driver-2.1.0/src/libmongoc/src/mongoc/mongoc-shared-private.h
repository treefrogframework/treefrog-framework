/**
 * @brief A ref-counted thread-safe shared pointer to arbitrary data.
 *
 * `shared_ptr` instances manage the lifetime of a pointed-to object when the
 * precise time to destroy that managed object is indeterminate, such as with
 * shared state in a multithreaded or asynchronous program.
 *
 * The pointed-to object of a shared_ptr instance can be accessed via
 * the `ptr` member of the shared_ptr object. Assigning-to the `ptr` member of
 * a shared_ptr is legal, and can be done to change the pointed-to object of a
 * shared_ptr without changing which object is being managed. This can be done
 * to return a pointer to a subobject of the managed object without giving
 * out a reference to the full managed object.
 *
 * A new managed object with a `shared_ptr` is created with
 * `mongoc_shared_ptr_create`, which starts with an initial shared reference
 * count of `1`. To take another reference to keep the managed object alive,
 * use `mongoc_shared_ptr_copy`. When one is done with a managed resource, the
 * shared reference should be dropped using `mongoc_shared_ptr_reset_null`.
 *
 * When an operation on a shared_ptr causes the reference count to drop to zero,
 * the deleter that was given to create that shared state will immediately be
 * invoked with the pointed-to-data. The deleter runs in the thread that
 * caused the reference count to drop, so be aware that resetting or assigning
 * a shared_ptr can execute unseen code: Refrain from holding locks while
 * resetting/assigning a shared pointer.
